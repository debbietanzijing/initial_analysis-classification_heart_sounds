# initial_analysis-classification_heart_sounds
The goal of this project is to conduct an initial exploratory review of the PhysioNet Challenge dataset and existing literature to guide the development of a normalised high quality dataset for validating a novel heart sound recording device. 

# Background 
Advances in technology have created new opportunities to detect early signs of cardiac abnormalities via heart sound recordings (phonocardiograms) through machanical cardiac events (S1, S2, murmurs). These signals are analyzed with mordern signal processing, and can be used in predicting models (with machine learning techniques) to spport screening and triage in low resource settings. 

Large open access resources such as the PhysioNet Challenge (2016-2022) was initially set up to encourage the development of algorithms to classify heart sound recordings, identify murmur presence and detect pathology across diverse recording environments. This is done via a single recording in a precordial location.

For a novel asculation devices, there is a need to create clean, standardised and demographically representative normative dataset. This will provide a reliable baseline for comparison, and a ground truth for future models.

# Data
The data is compiled from multiple research groups across the world, recorded in different real world clinical and nonclinical environments (home visits), depending on individual protocols. It includes not only clean hear sounds,

# Objectives: 
* Identify predictive features to be included in the model
* Identify risk factors relevant to prediction outcomes
* Identify elements that can or cannot be generalised to a new device context
